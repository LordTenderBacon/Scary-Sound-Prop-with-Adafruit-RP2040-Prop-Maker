# Scary-Sound-Prop-with-Adafruit-RP2040-Prop-Maker
A fun Halloween project using an Adafruit RP2040 Prop-Maker with a 16-LED NeoPixel ring, a 4-ohm speaker, and a 3.7V 2200mAh lithium battery. This prop plays a scary voice or sound effect (easily customizable) and controls a servo. The NeoPixel ring lights up in sync with the audio for a spooky effect!
